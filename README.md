# Mean, Variance, Standard Deviation, and More Calculator

📊 A Python calculator that computes mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum from nine numbers.

This project demonstrates how to perform basic statistical calculations in Python using NumPy.
The program takes a list of nine numbers, reshapes it into a 3×3 matrix, and then computes descriptive statistics row-wise, column-wise, and for the entire matrix.

⚡ Features

✔️ Input validation (ensures exactly 9 numbers are provided)

✔️ Reshaping into a 3x3 matrix

✔️ Calculates:

- Mean

- Variance

- Standard Deviation

- Maximum

- Minimum

- Sum

✔️ Results returned in a dictionary format
